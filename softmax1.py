# # Assignment 1-3: Softmax
# 
# This exercise is analogous to the SVM exercise. You will:
# 
# - implement a fully-vectorized **loss function** for the Softmax classifier
# - implement the fully-vectorized expression for its **analytic gradient**
# - **check your implementation** with numerical gradient

# ### Discussion

# 1. Both the methods have the same loss value indicating that the implementations are functionally correct.
# 2. The vectorized implementation is twice faster compared to the naive implementation.
# 3. Both methods have same loss and gradients so that the loss differece and gradient difference are zero.
